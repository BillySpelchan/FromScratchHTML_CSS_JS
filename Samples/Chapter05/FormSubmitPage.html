<h1>Welcome to the submit page</h1>
<p>Normally we would use some type of backend program or language (such as PHP) to generate the content for this page.
As the book this demo does not cover server side programming, this is just a normal web page.
That means we don't have any form information.</p>
<p>This page may have either been opened as a new tab, in which case close the tab, or as a replacement for the demo page in which case you need to use the back button.</p>
<p>If you would like to see me write a book on LAMP or MEAN or MERN let me know and if there is enough interest, explore this topic for creating multi-player games in JavaScript.</p>
