<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  The project for chapter 2 is the game of NIM. As with all projects in this book, the reference version that I create only uses the material and concepts that have been covered up to this point. As this chapter is the first programming-related chapter in the book, there is not much so the game is necessarily primitive. The game is rather ugly due to the lack of any CSS, and since we have not covered JavaScript yet, we are very restricted with what we can accomplish. Just using links is surprisingly powerful, but as you add more states to a game the number of pages needed to be created blows up very quickly. Still, creating a game with only HTML is possible.
