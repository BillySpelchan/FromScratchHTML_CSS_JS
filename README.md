# FromScratchHTML_CSS_JS
## Introduction
This is the repository for the book I am working on and slowly releasing (one section per week) on Spelchan.com. This book looks at creating games using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while teaching all three of these “languages”. The cheat sheets, samples, and project solutions will be posted here after the related section has been posted on my site.

## Cheat sheets
Each chapter of my book, other than introduction and conclusion, has a cheat sheet covering the topics of that chapter. The idea is that readers can use this as a quick reference and people with existing experience can review the cheat sheet to see if they should bother with the chapter. I will group all the cheat sheets into a directory.

## Samples
Some of the more complex topics may have their own sample pages. The samples found in the chapters will be in their own directory under the samples directory.

## Projects
While I will be posting my version of the sample project when each chapter starts, the source code will not be officially posted to the repository until after the making-of section of the book has been posted. The projects directory will have a separate sub-directory for the 9 projects. The projects planned (subject to change) for the book are:
- *NIM* – a game created with ONLY HTML.
- *Hunt the Webbus* – a clone of a classic game, created using only a small subset of HTML and CSS.
- *Where’s Wendy* - a simple JavaScript search game
- *Trivia* – a simple trivia game covering the topic of the first five chapters of the book
- *Tic Tac Toe* – Obvious what this game is
- *Threes* – a hotseat version of a simple dice game
- *Space Miner* – a clone of a classic arcade game where you mine asteroids while avoiding hostile competitors.
- *Solitaire* – your classic Klondike solitaire card game
- *Four in a Row* – a classic game where we explore AI concepts while taking advantage of threads by using web workers.
